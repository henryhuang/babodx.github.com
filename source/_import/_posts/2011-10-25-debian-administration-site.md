title: 一个关于debian系统管理的站点
---
这个站点有很多关于debian系统管理的信息和经验。
不过这个站点对于IE支持不好，页面会出现错位。建议还是采用firefox或者chrome这类的浏览器吧。

简介如下，照搬的原文：
<h1>Debian Administration</h1>
This site was created as a simple weblog designed to contain interesting and useful information related to the System Administration of <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a> systems.
Whilst there are several sites where users can post questions and have answers contributed by other users there are no other sites on the web which are specifically targeted at distributing articles of interest to Debian administrators.
This site is designed to fill that void, with content accepted from users.
Feel free to <a href="http://www.debian-administration.org/create/user">create your own account</a> and <a href="http://www.debian-administration.org/create/article">contribute an article, tip, or question</a> you may also <a href="http://www.debian-administration.org/create/poll">submit a poll</a>.
User accounts aren't necessary but they do allow you to do several additional things:
<ul>
<li>See your own comment and story posting history </li>
<li>Bookmark articles, polls, or weblogs of interest to you. </li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.debian-administration.org/about/FAQ%20:%20Tags">Tag articles</a>. </li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.debian-administration.org/about/FAQ%20:%20Site%20Adverts">Disable the adverts</a> shown upon article pages. <ul>
<li>Or <a href="http://www.debian-administration.org/create/advert">Create your own advert</a> </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create and post weblog entries. </li>
<li>Ensure the use of our <a href="http://www.debian-administration.org/about/SSL%20Certificate">SSL certificate</a> by always using https://. </li>
</ul>From your account page you can customize several aspects of the site - such as which sections are displayed in the sidebar, whether to receive notifications if other people reply to your comments, etc.
It should be noted that this site is neither an official part of the Debian project, nor endorsed by it. <a href="http://www.debian.org/">The Debian project</a> has its own official website, and the name Debian is a trademark held by <a href="http://www.spi-inc.org/">Software In the Public Interest</a>.<div id="related_log" style="font-size:12px">
